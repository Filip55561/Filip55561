# Filip55561

I'm just a student interested in programming using C# or Lua
I love gaming, programming, music and more. *Don't expect me to finish most of my projects :P*

## Projects

- MineLua \[Private\] - From the title, written in Lua. This is my spinoff of Minecraft with my own twists. *Trying to work on it*

- VK \[Private\] - An FNF mod I'm working on, can't share much here because it's not finished :P

- [QuickEdit](https://github.com/HEJOK254/Discord-QuickEdit) - A Discord bot for quick editing or dealing with files/media. I've made a few commits here, please check it out.
